notes for the game-

1.We added the option for the player to exit the game and return to the main menu, even if the player hasnâ€™t been completely disqualified, by pressing the key '9', as mentioned in the instructions page.
2.When Mario reaches a state of disqualification, it is visually indicated by Mario flashing for a few seconds in place (while the screen freezes), followed by transitioning to the disqualification screen.
While climbing a ladder, the player has the option to move left , right or stay. If they are not on the ground(when they move left or right), they will fall.3 .
4.If Mario falls, and not necessarily from 5 floors or more, and he doesn't land on a floor (mario land on the the screen boundaries or on the Q), it will cause his disqualification. In other words, if he lands and there's no floor, it's like there's 'fire' beneath him.
We were asked to add a link to Amir's answer regarding this topic :

5.When the player selects a specific level, he only plays that level. After completing this level, he returns to the level selection menu and can choose another level.
6.When Mario uses the hammer, he can kill ghosts or barrels when they are one or two characters away.
7.Killing a barrel or a ghost earns one point (In each level the score is reset ).
