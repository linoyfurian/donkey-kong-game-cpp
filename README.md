# Donkey Kong Game (C++)

ðŸŽ® A simple version of the classic **Donkey Kong** game implemented in C++, using object-oriented programming principles.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This project is a console-based implementation of the Donkey Kong arcade game.  
The game logic, structure, and design are built using C++ (OOP), focusing on clarity, modularity, and maintainability.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Modular design using C++ classes (e.g., `Game`, `Board`, `Ghost`, `Barrel`, `Mario`, etc.)
- Two gameplay modes: Manual and Automatic
- Ghost AI and multiple types of enemies
- Screen file parsing and configuration files
- Game result tracking and scoring
- Clean architecture with headers and implementation files separated

## ðŸ§  Concepts & Technologies

- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, encapsulation)
- File I/O (reading level data, game screens)
- Basic game loop and rendering logic in console
- Memory management in C++
